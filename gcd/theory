Gcd logic is in eucledian algo which says that you can subtract 2 numbers from each other and there gcd would still be same

if a > b,
so you can go like gcd (a,b) = gcd(a-b, a)

like a = 10, b = 5
gcd(10,5) = gcd (10-5, 5) = gcd(5,5)
gcd(5,5) = gcd(5-5,5) = gcd(0,5)

once you reach zero, then the other number is GCD

So a simple subtract code could work but that is very slow, what you can do is see something like this

a - b, b
a - 2b, b
a- 3b, b
a - 4b, b
...
a - k*b, b

where k is max times B can be subtracted before it going small,

MEANING

we could directly do gcd (a,b) = gcd(a%b,b)
till again the someone reaches zero
