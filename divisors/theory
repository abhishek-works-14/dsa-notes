So see wanna all divisors, simple thing is seeing going till half of number and storing its values like from
1 ....... 10
1 10
2 5

and reverse all true, so
10, 1
5, 2

so we can see it goes till half so we can go till 1 -> n/2 and check and store the org value and number it divided by so 1 2 5 10

HERE'S THE SCENE

check this image by striver
![Divisors image](divisors.png)

Here we can see that if getting divisors for 36
1 36
2 18
4 9
6 6
.. rest gets repeated so we can actually just go till sqrt n and store both values
